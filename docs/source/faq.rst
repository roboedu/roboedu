FAQ

How do I ask a question?
------------------------

We are using piazza for asking question. Our intend is to first gather
the answer on piazza and than move the answer in some form to the web
page if appropriate.

However asking a quaestion may require some effort on your part.

We suggest the following

* Before asking the quetion look at the Class Web site and in
  piazza. Both have search functions that you can use.
* Do not burry your question in an unrelated post. INstead use the
  **New Post** button
* Provide enough information in the questions. THis may include:

  * yur name
  * your HID
  * the exact URL where the issue aooruce (if related to the Web page
    or piaza)
  * detailed description of what the error is about
  * Make use of the online sessions so you can demonstrate the issue
    if it complicated to describe

What are the prerequisites for this class?
------------------------------------------

We have communicated the prerequisites to the university, but they may
have forgotten to add them to the class.  The perquisites can be found
in the appropriate class overview. Please review them carefully.

See:

* I524 :ref:`ref-i524-prerequisits`

Why is this class not hosted on EdX?
------------------------------------

I523 and I524 were the first classes hosted on EdX. We wanted to
continue offering them on EdX. However, the university system
administrators mentioned to us that their systems are not ready to
support this class in EdX. Unfortunately, this is out of our control
and we hope that the university will soon update to an EdX system that
can host our classes.

Why are you not using CANVAS for communicating with students?
-------------------------------------------------------------

We have found that Piazza supports our needs for communication better than Canvas.

Why are you using github for submitting projects and papers?
------------------------------------------------------------

This class is about open source technology and we like that you benefit
from material others in the class are developing or have developed. All
assignments are openly submitted to the class github for everyone to
see. As part of the goal of this class is to develop reusable
deployments. Such reuse is only possible if the code is publicly
available and others can benefit from it.

The technology papers are made accessible so you can read other
technology papers and can get an introduction in technologies that you
may not yet know about. It also allows others to contribute to your
technology papers and improve them.


I am full time student at IUPUI. Can I take the online version?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes you can.

If you are an international student, I suggest you verify this with
the office and the registrar. There may be some restrictions for
international students. Also some degree programs may have a limit or
do not allow to take online classes. It will be up to you to verify
the requirements with the appropriate administrators.

I am a residential student at IU. Can I take the online version only?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend you take the residential class.

If you are an international student or a student of a particular
degree program restrictions may be placed in if and how many online
courses you can take. It will be up to you to contact the appropriate
administrative departments including the international student office
to verify what is allowed for you. In general international students
have such restrictions. Please find out what they are and which
section of the course is appropriate for you. 

The class is full what do I do?
-------------------------------

#. Make sure to put yourself on the waiting list.
#. If you are a residential student show up on the first class in the
   specified lecture room. More likely than not some students will
   enroll in more classes than they can do and places will free up. We
   will create a list and discuss with the registrar what to do.
   
Do I need to buy a textbook?
----------------------------

No, the resources will be provided for every unit. However, we
recommend that you identify useful books for the class that can help
you. Examples include

#. “Taming The Big Data Tidal Wave: Finding Opportunities in Huge Data
   Streams with Advanced Analytics”, Bill Franks Wiley ISBN:
   978-1-118-20878-6
#. “Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline”, Cathy O'Neil,
   Rachel Schutt, O'Reilly Media, ISBN 978-1449358655

If you find good books, we like to add them here.
   
Why is there no textbook?
-------------------------

We cover a wide range of topics and their subject-matter is constantly
undergoing changes. A textbook would be out of date by the time of
publishing.

Do I need a computer to participate in this class?
--------------------------------------------------

If you are an online student you need access to a computer. If you
are a residential student the facilities provided by SOIC will be
sufficient. However, as you study involves computers, its probably
important to evaluate if a computer will make your work easier. 

If it comes to what computer to buy we really do not have a good
recommendation as this depends on your budget. A computer running
Linux or OSX makes programming probably easier. A windows computer has
the advantage of also being able to run Word and ppt (so does OSX). A
cheap machine with multiple cores and sufficient memory (16GB+) is a
good idea. A SSD will make access to data especially if large data
snappy.

For this reason I myself use a Mac, but you probably can get much
cheaper machines with similar specs elsewhere.

Other students bought themselves a cheap computer and installed Linux
on it so they do not interfere with their work machines or with
Windows. Given how inexpensive computers these days are this may be a
reasonable idea. However, do not go too cheap have enough memory and
use an SSD if you can.

Which bibliography manager is required for the class?
-----------------------------------------------------

We require you use jabref:

Can I use endnote or other bibliography managers?
-------------------------------------------------

No. Jabref is best for us and we do require that you hand in all

How many hours will this course take to work on every week?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This question can not rely be answered precisely. Typically we have
2-3 hours video per week. However starting from that its difficult to
put a real number down as things may also depend on your background.

* The programming load is modest, but requires knowledge in python and
  linux systems which you may have to learn outside of this class.

* Some students have more experience than others, thus it may be
  possible to put in 6 hours per week overall, but other may have to
  put in 12 hours, while yet others may enjoy this class so much that
  they spend a lot more hours.

* We will certainly not stopping you form spending time in the class.
  It will be up to you to figure out how much time you will spend.

* Please remember that procrastination will not pay of in this class.
  
* The project or term paper will take a significant amount of time.

Is all classes material final?
------------------------------

No. Class material can change. Please remember that in a normal class
you will be given several hours of lectures a week. They will be
released on a weekly basis. What we do here is to release the material
as much as possible upfront and **correct** them when we find it
necessary to provide improvements or additions. Additionally, we
integrate your feedback into the classes. If you find errors on the
class Web page or have additions that you want to add, we would like
to hear from you. Pull requests can be issued by you so your
contributions get acknowledged and rewarded as part of the grade.

What are the changes to the web page?
-------------------------------------

The changes we make are typically fixing errata or clarification of
content. We do attempt to indicate when major change is made.

What lectures should I learn when?
----------------------------------

The class is structured in lectures that you can listen to at any
time. If you have difficulties with organizing your own calendar, we
will develop a sample calendar for you. Please contact us. However we
have undergraduates, graduates, residential and online students. We
even have students that can only work part of the semester while they
use their vacation. Hence, it is impossible for us to provide an exact
calendar that satisfies all the different types of students. Hence we
appeal to your organizational skills to create a "study" plan for you
during the first week of the semester that works for you.

We recommend to do the theory lectures as quickly as possible, but
also start learning ansible at the same time as this will be part of
your project. You will fail if you assume you can do the project in 2
weeks. You will need to work on it all semester long on weekly basis,
starting with learning how to use ansible and cloud resources.

I524: Why are you doing the papers?
-----------------------------------

Part of doing research is to communicate your thoughts on topics and
to be able to analyze and evaluate technologies that may or may not be
useful for you. Our goal within this class is for the first time to
gather a significant portion of the technologies that you hear about
in class and that you get exposed to as part of the technology list
into a "proceedings" developed by all students in class. The papers
serve also the dual purpose of you learning how to write a paper and
use bibliographies.

I524: Why are there no homework to test me on skills such as ansible or python?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We used to do smaller homework in previous classes to evaluate you on
your skills. However we found that they did not reflect real-world use
cases. By focusing on the project instead, you will be forced to
develop these skills.

However, we can provide you with additional ungraded homework that you
can conduct to test your skills if you like. Please let us know if you
like to do that and we can assign such homework to you.

I524: Why not use chef or another DevOps framework?
---------------------------------------------------

We used to use chef and other DevOps frameworks. However we found that
for a class grading can not be uniformly conducted while using too
many frameworks. We also found that the value of learning on how to
collaboratively contribute as part of an opensource class was
diminished while a small group were choosing other technologies. These
groups complained later on that they had too much work and could not
benefit from other students. Hence we make is simple. All DevOps must
be provided in ansible. All programming must be provided in python if
not an explicit reason exist to use another language or technology
such as R or technologies such as neo4j. However all deployment must
be done in python and ansible.

I am lost?
-----------

Please contact the instructors for your class.

I do not like Technology/Topic/Project/etc?
-------------------------------------------

Please contact the instructors for your class.

I am not able to attend the online hours
----------------------------------------

Typically we provide many different times for meetings via Zoom. We
even schedule within reason special sessions. All of them are however
during reasonable hours in United States Easter Standard Time.

Do I need to attend the online sessions?
----------------------------------------

No. But you can ask any question you want. We found that in previous
classes that some students clearly benefitted from online sessions.
If you attend them make sure you have a working and tested microphone
if possible.

What are the leaning outcomes?
------------------------------

If you feel that they are not clearly stated as part of the course
please contact us so that we can clarify the material.


There are so many messages on Piazza I can not keep up.
-------------------------------------------------------

Residential students typically participate in live lectures in which
we discuss with each other important aspects of a topic. As an online
class may not have such a lecture, the piazza posts are just a
replacement of them. It is required that you read the posts and decide
which of them are relevant for you. In a lecture room you will find
also that one student asks a question, while the professor answers the
question to the entire class.

I find the hosting Web confusing
--------------------------------

Once in a while we find that a student finds the hosting of the class
material on the class Web page confusing. This confusion can be
overcome by doing the following:

1. You may have to take time to explore the Web page and identify what
   needs to be done for the class. However each class has a clear
   overview page.
2. You may have to learn to get used to a class that allows you to work
   ahead. 
3. You may have to learn to appreciate the additional material that
   assist in learning about python, ansible, LaTex, or the many other
   topics
4. Please do not blame the instructors for things that are out of
   their control: You may not be aware that it is not the instructors
   fault that the university is not able to provide us with an EdX
   server that works for us. Our choice would be to use EdX.

   
I524: I do not know python. What do I do?
-----------------------------------------

This class requires python. Please learn it. We will be using ansible
for the project. This you can acquire as part of the class through
self study. There is a section under lessosn that has some elementary
python included.


How to solve merge conflict in Pull Request?
--------------------------------------------

Make sure you have upstream repo defined::

  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes

 

Backup all your changed files - just in case you need them while merging the changes back

 

Get latest from upstream::

  $ git rebase upstream/master

 

In this step, the conflicting file shows up (in my case it was refs.bib)::

  $ git status

should show the name of the conflicting file::

  $ git diff <file name>

should show the actual differences. In some cases, it is easy to
simply take latest version from upstream and reapply your changes. So
you can decide to checkout one version earlier of the specific file.


.. note::
   
   You can find the version number with::

     $ git log --oneline

   You can checkout a specific version with::

     $ git checkout <version number - e.g. ed13c06> <file name>


At this stage, the re-base should be complete. So, you need to commit
and push the changes to your fork::

  $ git commit
  $ git rebase origin/master
  $ git push


Then reapply your changes to refs.bib - simply use the backedup
version and use the editor to redo the changes.

At this stage, only refs.bib is changed::

  $ git status

should show the changes only in refs.bib.

Commit this change using:: 

  $ git commit -a -m "new:usr: <message>"

 

And finally push the last commited change::

  $ git push

 

The changes in the file to resolve merge conflict automatically goes
to the original pull request and the pull request can be merged
automatically

Cheat sheet for Linux commands
------------------------------

Usage of a particular command and all the attributes associated with
it, use 'man' command. Avoid using 'rm -r' command to delete files
recursively. A good way to avoid accidental deletion is to include the
following in your .bash_profile file::

  alias e=open_emacs
  alias rm='rm -i'
  alias mv='mv -i' 
  alias h='history'

Tips: TechList.1 homework
-------------------------
 
.. warning:: why is this not placed in techlist-hw.rst?

Citations
~~~~~~~~~

Do not mention the authors of a citation that you use. 

Example do not say:

As Gregor von Laszewski pointed out with flowery words in an article published recently .... [1]

Instead use: In [1] ...    

Naturally you shoudl use the \cite command.
 
Spelling
~~~~~~~~

* use a space after periods, and commas in a centence
* use a spellchecker
* do the indentation properly as demonstrated in the examples. (use
  fixed width font to edit RST to see it more easily)

Github
~~~~~~

* when dounig your pull request, make sure you do not have any conflists, rebase if needed

Rubric
~~~~~~
 
We already commented on what a good entry looks like so its rather
simple, avoid plagiarism, subsections in the text, keep bullet lists
minimal, be short but provide enough detail, dont just copy from the
web page, relate technology to big data if you can

 

* a write a good introdcution to the technology that summarizes what it is (and if possible how it relates to big data)

* include the most important refernces and prepare them in correct bibtex format

* check in your contribution (obviously if you can not do that ask for help form the TAs so you get educated on git)

* you get 50% of your points from the writeup and 50% of the points from the bibliography

 
You are allowed to work in teams to improve your own submissions. 

     
Timeliness
~~~~~~~~~~

You will safe yourself a lot of hazle if you check in your assignment
early.  ON the last day typically a lot of checkins happen and may
require you to do a rebase. The sooner you do it the easier for you.

 

 

Outdated Tech ology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the technology assigned to me is 'Ninefold'. It seems ninefold
has shutdown their cloud service on January 30, 2016. Should I write a
tech summary for ninefold or do we have remove this from the techlist
as it is no longer in operation?

 

Kindly refer: 

http://ninefold.com/

http://ninefold.com/news/

 

Note: Outdated and unnecessary technologies will be removed by the TAs. 


Techlist 1 and Paper 1 : Pagecount
----------------------------------

TechLIst = a couple of paragraphs (so real short, see the NAGIOS example

 

Paper 1 = 2 pages in the format we specified, images and refs not included. See at the end of the paper format for a suitable layout

 

PS: If your paper is longer or if it a paragraph short that does not matter to us, important is the content


Tips to Install Virtualbox
--------------------------
A video on how to install virtual box on windows 10 can be seen as part of an unrelated course on youtube at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvCUpZuHgvo 

It is a bit wordy as the presenter complains about the difficulties to
record videos on windows 10, and talks about his course, so just
ignore these portions. Naturally use whatever is the newest
version. Here is one for Windows 8 which also contains ubuntu install
(use the one above on how to install vb on windows 10 and ignore that
part form the window bellow)

Do I generate the SSH key on Ubuntu VM ?
----------------------------------------

I have installed Ubuntu(on virtual box) on my windows 10 system. I
wanted to confirm if the SSH key should be created on the Ubuntu VM?
Yes we need to generate ssh on Ubuntu VM, because even it is a VM or a
real machine we have to set up ssh in order to work with ssh based
communication, in order to maintain security when you are using an
application like Github.

You need to generate SSH, no matter what operating system you are
using or on which operating system you are running VM.

First let us revisit what an ssh key is for. A key pair has a public
and a private key pair. If a remote machine has the public key from
another machine you will be able to login to that machine form the
machine where you have created the public and private key pair from.
Some services do require key authentication. Such services include:

a) login to any virtual machine

b) using github

c) login to the login nodes of futuresystems 

Thus if you like ta access any of them any computer on which you want
to access them from need a key pair. (or key as we sometimes
abbreviate).

So if you like to access from your ubuntu vm future systems which you
want you need one, if you want to access githu, you need one, if you
want to login to vas on chameleon cloud you need one, if you want to
login to vas on jetstreem you need one, if you want .... you need one.

 

So the answer is yes. Under no circumstances copy the private key to
another computer as that is a security violation. You can only copy
the public key. That is the reason its called public. On each machine
where you like to access these services you need to create a different
key and add the public key to the remote services/machines you want to
access.


Ways to run Ubuntu on Windows 10
--------------------------------

There are multiple ways to get ubuntu onto Windows.

a) The recommended way to do it is via virtual box which seems to work
for most, but requires sometimes that the bios settings need to be
adjusted. Naturally we do not know what your bios settings are so you
need to figure this out from the internet. However in 99% of the cases
virtual box works nicely.A student tip describes what needs to be
done:
 
You need the virtual box software
(https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) that corresponds to the
operating system running on the physical machine in front of you. Then
download the Ubuntu 16.04 .iso file
(https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) to your computer. Start
virtual box. I think a wizard starts to guide you through setting up a
new virtual machine when you choose "new". Then brows to where you
downloaded the iso file and click on it. you will have to start this
and ubuntu will start installing. (improve this description if
something is not clear)

b) the other way of installing bash on windows is as subsystem as
documented by your fellow students. This may not fulfill the
requirements of running ansible, but it will help you to get started
quickly while running bash on your host directly. It is often referred
to as "ubuntu on windows".

How can I download lecture sildes ?

Please refer to the following link.

Don't use Anaconda
------------------

We use python 2.7.13 for this class. It is better to use Virtualenv
and pip. And for the IDE, you can use PyCharm. This is the open source
way of doing python, while we use 2.7 because not everything is yet
available in 3.5. We do not recommend Anaconda or Canopy. In fact we
found issues with both. Especially with Canopy. It was incompatible
with libraries the open source community uses and it negatively
effected a students system wide python install. We had to reinstall
python completely after we uninstalled canopy. Unfortunately it did
cost us a lot of time to fix this. TAs will not provide any help in
case you use anaconda or canopy.


Using SSH Key for Git Push
--------------------------

When you cloned your repository did you use SSH rather than HTTPS?
Your clone command should look like this:

$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/classes.git

You can use git remote set-url as described here to change from HTTPS
to SSH: https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/

Changing the origin remote (as opposed to both origin and upstream)
will be sufficient, since this is the only one you push into.



How to properly research a bibtex entry
---------------------------------------

Often you may find via google a bibtex entry that may need some more
reserach. Lets assume your first google quesry returns a publication
and you cite it such as this::


  @Unpublished{unpublished-google-sawzall,
      Title = {{Interpreting the Data: Parallel Analysis with Sawzall}},
      Author = {{Rob Pike, Sean Dorward, Robert Griesemer, Sean Quinlan}},
      Note = {accessed 2017-01-28},
      Month = {October},
      Year = {2005},
      Owner = {for the purpose of this discussion removed},
      Timestamp = {2017.01.31}
  }

Could we improve this entry to achieve your best?

1) firts of all the author field has a wrong entry as the , is to be replaced by an and.

2) The author feild  has authors and thus must not have a {{ }}

3) The url is missing, as the simple google search actually finds a PDF document. 

So let us investigate a bit more. Let us search for the title. So we find

 
A) https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj_ytSA-PDRAhUH8IMKHaomC-oQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.google.com%2Farchive%2Fsawzall-sciprog.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHSSfKBwbxVAVPQ0td4rTjitKucpA&sig2=vbiVzi36B3gGFjIzlUKBDA&bvm=bv.146073913,d.amc

C) http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1239658

 
Let us look at A)

As you can see from the url this is actualy some redirection to a
google web page which probably is replaced by B as its from google
research. So let us look at B)

Now when you look at the link we find the url
https://research.google.com/archive/sawzall-sciprog.pdf which
redirects you to the PDF paper.
 
When we go to B) we find surprisingly a bibtex entry as follows::

  @article{61,
    title = {Interpreting the Data: Parallel Analysis with Sawzall},
    author = {Rob Pike and Sean Dorward and Robert Griesemer and Sean Quinlan},
    year = 2005,
    URL = {https://research.google.com/archive/sawzall.html},
    journal = {Scientific Programming Journal},
    pages = {277--298},
    volume = {13}
  }


Now we could say lets be satisfied, but C) seems to be even more
interesting as its from a major publisher. So lats just make sure we
look at C)

 

If you go to C, you find under the colored box entitled Tools and
Resources a link called **bibtex**. Thus it seems a good idea to click
on it. This will give you::

 

  @article{Pike:2005:IDP:1239655.1239658,
      author = {Pike, Rob and Dorward, Sean and Griesemer, Robert and Quinlan, Sean},
      title = {Interpreting the Data: Parallel Analysis with Sawzall},
      journal = {Sci. Program.},
      issue_date = {October 2005},
      volume = {13},
      number = {4},
      month = oct,
      year = {2005},
      issn = {1058-9244},
      pages = {277--298},
      numpages = {22},
      url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2005/962135},
      doi = {10.1155/2005/962135},
      acmid = {1239658},
      publisher = {IOS Press},
      address = {Amsterdam, The Netherlands, The Netherlands},
  }
 
Now we seem to be at a position to combine our entries and get a nice
bibtex reference. As the doi number properly specifies a paper (look
up what a doi is) we can replace the url with one that we find online,
such as the one we found in A) Next we see that all field sin B are
already coverd in C, so we take C) and add the url. Now as the label
is graet and uniform for ACM, but for us a bit less convenient as its
difficult to remember, we just change it while for example using
authors, title, and year information. lets also make sure to do mostly
lowercase in the label just as a convention. Thus our entry looks
like::

  @article{pike05swazall,
      author = {Pike, Rob and Dorward, Sean and Griesemer, Robert and Quinlan, Sean},
      title = {Interpreting the Data: Parallel Analysis with Sawzall},
      journal = {Sci. Program.},
      issue_date = {October 2005},
      volume = {13},
      number = {4},
      month = oct,
      year = {2005},
      issn = {1058-9244},
      pages = {277--298},
      numpages = {22},
      url = {https://research.google.com/archive/sawzall-sciprog.pdf},
      doi = {10.1155/2005/962135},
      acmid = {1239658},
      publisher = {IOS Press},
      address = {Amsterdam, The Netherlands, The Netherlands},
  }
 
As you can see finding a refernce takes multiple google quesries and
merging of the results you find from various returms. As you still
have time to correct things I advise that you check your refernces and
correct them. If the original refernce would have been graded it would
have been graded with a "fail" instead of a "pass".

 
A second example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets look at a second obvious example that needs improvement::

  
  @InProceedings{wettinger-any2api,
    Title                    = {Any2API - Automated APIfication},
    Author                   = {Wettinger, Johannes and
                                Uwe Breitenb{\"u}cher
                                and Frank Leymann},
    Booktitle                = {Proceedings of the 5th International
                                Conference on Cloud Computing and
				Services Science},
    Year                     = {2015},
    Pages                    = {475­486},
    Publisher                = {SciTePress},

    ISSN                     = {2326-7550},
    Owner                    = {S17-IO-3005},
    Url                      = {https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1cd4/4b87be8cf68ea5c4c642d38678a7b40a86de.pdf}
  }

As you can see this entry seems to define all required fields, so we
could be tempted to stop here. But its good to double check. Lets do
some queries against ACM, . and google scholar, so we jst type in
the title, and if this is in a proceedings they should return hopeflly
a predefined bibtex record for us.

Lets query::

  google: googlescholar Any2API Automated APIfication

We get:

*
https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=j6lIXt0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=j6lIXt0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC

On that page we see `Cite
<https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Automated+drug+dispensing+system+reduces+medication+errors+in+an+intensive+care+setting&author=Chapuis&publication_year=2010#>`_

So we find a PDF at
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1cd4/4b87be8cf68ea5c4c642d38678a7b40a86de.pdf

Lets click on this and the document incldes a bibtex entry such as::

  @inproceedings{Wettinger2015,	
    author= {Johannes Wettinger and Uwe Breitenb{\"u}cher and Frank
	     Leymann},
    title = {Any2API - Automated APIfication},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Cloud
		 Computing and Service Science (CLOSER)},
    year = {2015},
    pages = {475--486},
    publisher = {SciTePress}
  }	

Now lets add the URL and owner::

  @inproceedings{Wettinger2015,	
    author= {Johannes Wettinger and Uwe Breitenb{\"u}cher and Frank
	     Leymann},
    title = {Any2API - Automated APIfication},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Cloud
		 Computing and Service Science (CLOSER)},
    year = {2015},
    pages = {475--486},
    publisher = {SciTePress},
    url ={https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1cd4/4b87be8cf68ea5c4c642d38678a7b40a86de.pdf},
    owner = {S17-IO-3005},
  }	

Should we be satisfied? No, even our
original information we gathere provided more information. So lets
continue. Lets googlesearch different queries with ACM or IEEE and the title. When doing
the IEEE in the example we find an entry called

`dlp: Frank Leyman <http%3A%2F%2Fdblp.uni-trier.de%2Fpers%2Fl%2FLeymann%3AFrank&usg=AFQjCNHCu-66qxWH0zRlPLr4DA8jIo5V-g&sig2=1vYdnGOEiMcLBEMpbeBA7g>`_ 

Lets look at it and we find two entries::

  @inproceedings{DBLP:conf/closer/WettingerBL15,
    author    = {Johannes Wettinger and
		 Uwe Breitenb{\"{u}}cher and
		 Frank Leymann},
    title     = {{ANY2API} - Automated APIfication - Generating APIs for Executables
		 to Ease their Integration and Orchestration for Cloud Application
		 Deployment Automation},
    booktitle = {{CLOSER} 2015 - Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on
		 Cloud Computing and Services Science, Lisbon, Portugal, 20-22 May,
		 2015.},
    pages     = {475--486},
    year      = {2015},
    crossref  = {DBLP:conf/closer/2015},
    url       = {http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0005472704750486},
    doi       = {10.5220/0005472704750486},
    timestamp = {Tue, 04 Aug 2015 09:28:21 +0200},
    biburl    = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/closer/WettingerBL15},
    bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org}
  }

  @proceedings{DBLP:conf/closer/2015,
    editor    = {Markus Helfert and
		 Donald Ferguson and
		 V{\'{\i}}ctor M{\'{e}}ndez Mu{\~{n}}oz},
    title     = {{CLOSER} 2015 - Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on
		 Cloud Computing and Services Science, Lisbon, Portugal, 20-22 May,
		 2015},
    publisher = {SciTePress},
    year      = {2015},
    isbn      = {978-989-758-104-5},
    timestamp = {Tue, 04 Aug 2015 09:17:34 +0200},
    biburl    = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/conf/closer/2015},
    bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org}
  }

So lets look at the entry and see how to get a better one for our
purpose to combine them. When using jabref, you see optional and
required fields, we want to add as many as possible, regardless if
optional or required, so Lets do that (I I write here in ASCII as
easier to document::
  


    @InProceedings{,
      author = 	 {},
      title = 	 {},
      OPTcrossref =  {},
      OPTkey = 	 {},
      OPTbooktitle = {},
      OPTyear = 	 {},
      OPTeditor = 	 {},
      OPTvolume = 	 {},
      OPTnumber = 	 {},
      OPTseries = 	 {},
      OPTpages = 	 {},
      OPTmonth = 	 {},
      OPTaddress = 	 {},
      OPTorganization = {},
      OPTpublisher = {},
      OPTnote = 	 {},
      OPTannote = 	 {}
    }

So lets copy and fill out the **form** from our various searches::

    @InProceedings{Wettinger2015any2api,	
      author    = {Johannes Wettinger and
  		 Uwe Breitenb{\"{u}}cher and
  		 Frank Leymann},
      title     = {{ANY2API} - Automated APIfication - Generating APIs for Executables
		 to Ease their Integration and Orchestration for Cloud Application
		 Deployment Automation},
      booktitle = {{CLOSER} 2015 - Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on
  		   Cloud Computing and Services Science},
      year = 	 {2015},
      editor    = {Markus Helfert and
 		   Donald Ferguson and
		   V{\'{\i}}ctor M{\'{e}}ndez Mu{\~{n}}oz},
      publisher = {SciTePress},
      isbn      = {978-989-758-104-5},
      pages = {475--486},
      month = {20-22 May},
      address = 	 {Lisbon, Portugal},
      doi       = {10.5220/0005472704750486},
      url ={https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1cd4/4b87be8cf68ea5c4c642d38678a7b40a86de.pdf},
      owner = {S17-IO-3005},
    }

What are the differnt entry types and fields
--------------------------------------------

We were asked what are the different entry types and fields, so we did
a google query and found the following useful information. please
remember that we also have fields such as doi, owner, we will add
status ={pass/fail} at time of grading to indicate if the refernce
passes or fails. We may assign this to you so you get familiar with
the identification if a referncei is ok or not.

Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX 

Can I write the papers on OSX?

Yes of course you can write papers on OSX. But we support for Ubuntu
16.04, because we consider it as the main OS that we use in this
class.  You can use, VM to install Ubuntu and use it for class work.

What is the nature of team collaboration on papers
--------------------------------------------------

You can build teams of three. You need to yourself build the team. The
web page tells you that there will be no reduction in numbers of
papers you write = number of team members * 3, papers can not be
combined.


What are the due dates for assignments
--------------------------------------

Due dates are posed on the Web page calendar.



What are good places to find refernce entries?
----------------------------------------------
